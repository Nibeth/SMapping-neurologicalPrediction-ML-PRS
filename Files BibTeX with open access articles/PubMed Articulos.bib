  abstract               = {Background: Schizophrenia and autism are examples of polygenic diseases caused by a multitude of genetic variants, many of which are still poorly understood. Recently, both diseases have been associated with disrupted neuron motility and migration patterns, suggesting that aberrant cell motility is a phenotype for these neurological diseases. Results: We formulate the Polygenic Disease Phenotype Problem which seeks to identify candidate disease genes that may be associated with a phenotype such as cell motility. We present a machine learning approach to solve this problem for schizophrenia and autism genes within a brain-specific functional interaction network. Our method outperforms peer semi-supervised learning approaches, achieving better cross-validation accuracy across different sets of gold-standard positives. We identify top candidates for both schizophrenia and autism, and select six genes labeled as schizophrenia positives that are predicted to be associated with cell motility for follow-up experiments. Conclusions: Candidate genes predicted by our method suggest testable hypotheses about these genesâ€™ role in cell motility regulation, offering a framework for generating predictions for experimental validation.
