	abstract={Better characterization of the preclinical phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is needed to develop effective interventions. Neuropathologic changes in AD, including neuronal loss and the formation of proteinaceous deposits, can begin 20 years before the onset of clinical symptoms. As such, the emergence of cognitive impairment should not be the sole basis used to diagnose AD or to evaluate individuals for enrollment in clinical trials for preventive AD treatments. Instead, early preclinical biomarkers of disease and genetic risk should be used to determine the most likely prognosis and to enroll individuals in appropriate clinical trials. Neuroimaging-based biomarkers and genetic analysis together present a powerful system for classifying preclinical pathology in patients. Disease-modifying interventions are more likely to produce positive outcomes when administered early in the course of AD. This review examines the utility of the neuroimaging genetics field as it applies to AD and early detection during the preclinical phase. Neuroimaging studies focused on single genetic risk factors are summarized. Particular focus is on the recent increased interest in polygenic methods, and the benefits and disadvantages of these approaches are discussed. Challenges in the neuroimaging genetics field, including limitations of statistical power arising from small effect sizes and the overuse of cross-sectional designs, are also discussed. Despite the limitations, neuroimaging genetics has already begun to influence clinical trial design and is expected to play a major role in the prevention of AD. "},

	abstract={Heterogeneity is a key feature of all psychiatric disorders that manifests on many levels, including symptoms, disease course, and biological underpinnings. These form a substantial barrier to understanding disease mechanisms and developing effective, personalized treatments. In response, many studies have aimed to stratify psychiatric disorders, aiming to find more consistent subgroups on the basis of many types of data. Such approaches have received renewed interest after recent research initiatives, such as the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria and the European Roadmap for Mental Health Research, both of which emphasize finding stratifications that are based on biological systems and that cut across current classifications. We first introduce the basic concepts for stratifying psychiatric disorders and then provide a methodologically oriented and critical review of the existing literature. This shows that the predominant clustering approach that aims to subdivide clinical populations into more coherent subgroups has made a useful contribution but is heavily dependent on the type of data used; it has produced many different ways to subgroup the disorders we review, but for most disorders it has not converged on a consistent set of subgroups. We highlight problems with current approaches that are not widely recognized and discuss the importance of validation to ensure that the derived subgroups index clinically relevant variation. Finally, we review emerging techniques—such as those that estimate normative models for mappings between biology and behavior—that provide new ways to parse the heterogeneity underlying psychiatric disorders and evaluate all methods to meeting the objectives of such as the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria and Roadmap for Mental Health Research.},

	pages={112732},
	note={ID: 271134},
	abstract={Preserving cognition and mental capacity is critical to aging with autonomy. Early detection of pathological cognitive decline facilitates the greatest impact of restorative or preventative treatments. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare is the use of computational algorithms that mimic human cognitive functions to analyze complex medical data. AI technologies like machine learning (ML) support the integration of biological, psychological, and social factors when approaching diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of disease. This paper serves to acquaint clinicians and other stakeholders with the use, benefits, and limitations of AI for predicting, diagnosing, and classifying mild and major neurocognitive impairments, by providing a conceptual overview of this topic with emphasis on the features explored and AI techniques employed. We present studies that fell into six categories of features used for these purposes: (1) sociodemographics; (2) clinical and psychometric assessments; (3) neuroimaging and neurophysiology; (4) electronic health records and claims; (5) novel assessments (e.g., sensors for digital data); and (6) genomics/other omics. For each category we provide examples of AI approaches, including supervised and unsupervised ML, deep learning, and natural language processing. AI technology, still nascent in healthcare, has great potential to transform the way we diagnose and treat patients with neurocognitive disorders.},

	note={ID: 271215},
	abstract={Deficits in decoding and understanding facially expressed emotions occur commonly in persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which contribute to the impairment of social communication that serves as one of its core diagnostic criteria. Research suggests that abnormalities of visual scanning of the face, activation of key nodes within the “social brain” by facially expressed emotions, functional connectivity within and between nodes of the “social brain”, and transduction of specific neurotransmitter/neuromodulatory signals contribute to the pathogenesis of these deficits in at least some persons with ASD. Importantly, the etiologies of these deficits are heterogeneous and include genetic, immunologic, and inflammatory mechanisms, as well as in utero exposures to drugs and toxins. The manifestation and severity of these deficits can also be influenced by developmental age, IQ and genetic background. Consistent with the goals of the Special Issue, the current Review is intended to familiarize the readership with several of the leading neurobiological mechanisms proposed to underlie these deficits in decoding facially expressed emotions and stimulate interest in translational preclinical and clinical investigations, whose ultimate purpose is to attenuate their severity and, thereby, improve functional outcomes of persons with ASD.},

	title={Independent and reproducible hippocampal radiomic biomarkers for multisite Alzheimer’s disease: diagnosis, longitudinal progress and biological basis},
	journal={Science Bulletin},
	note={ID: 315713},
	abstract={Hippocampal morphological change is one of the main hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether hippocampal radiomic features are robust as predictors of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia and whether these features provide any neurobiological foundation remains unclear. The primary aim of this study was to verify whether hippocampal radiomic features can serve as robust MRI markers for AD. Multivariate classifier-based SVM analysis provided individual-level predictions for distinguishing AD patients (n = 261) from normal controls (NCs; n = 231) with an accuracy of 88.21% and intersite cross-validation. Further analyses of a large, independent ADNI dataset (n = 1228) reinforced these findings. In MCI groups, a systemic analysis demonstrated that the identified features were significantly associated with clinical features (e.g., apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, polygenic risk scores, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ, CSF Tau), and longitudinal changes in cognition ability; more importantly, the radiomic features had a consistently altered pattern with changes in the MMSE scores over 5 years of follow-up. These comprehensive results suggest that hippocampal radiomic features can serve as robust biomarkers for clinical application in AD/MCI, and further provide evidence for predicting whether an MCI subject would convert to AD based on the radiomics of the hippocampus. The results of this study are expected to have a substantial impact on the early diagnosis of AD/MCI.},

	note={ID: 271080},
	abstract={The hippocampal complex, strongly implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is a region with functionally and structurally distinct subfields. Hippocampal subfield volumes may represent a more sensitive indicators of AD development than total hippocampal volume. We aimed to identify which subfield is the most predictive measure for an AD diagnosis and which is the most specific indicator of the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. We analyzed longitudinal structural neuroimaging data of 1350 individuals, 350 healthy controls (HC), 650 MCI and 350 AD, using FreeSurfer v6.0. The linear regression models corrected for total hippocampal volume revealed that subicular fields are the most predictive measures of AD diagnosis. Hippocampal fissure volume was significantly associated with conversion from MCI to AD. Our findings suggest that subicular hippocampal fields are most predictive of AD diagnosis, which has clinical implications for early detection. Specifically, subicular and hippocampal fissure volume measures may be used to select MCI participants who are most likely to convert in AD in clinical trials.},

Despite its marked potential for psychiatric care, this approach has not yet extended beyond the research setting to any clinically useful applications. Here we review current developments in the study of neuroimaging data using network models and machine learning methods, with a focus on their promise in offering a framework for clinical translation. We discuss 3 potential contributions of these methods to psychiatric care: 1) a better understanding of psychopathology beyond current diagnostic boundaries; 2) individualized prediction of treatment response and prognosis; and 3) formal theories to guide the development of novel interventions. Finally, we highlight current obstacles and sketch a forward-looking perspective of how the application of machine learning and network modeling methods should proceed to accelerate their potential transformation of clinically useful tools.},

	abstract={Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are among the leading causes of disability and mortality. Considerable sex differences exist in the occurrence of the various manifestations leading to cognitive decline. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exhibits substantial sexual dimorphisms and disproportionately affects women. Women have a higher life expectancy compared to men and, consequently, have more lifespan to develop AD. The emerging precision medicine and pharmacology concepts – taking into account the individual genetic and biological variability relevant for disease risk, prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment – are expected to substantially enhance our knowledge and management of AD. Stratifying the affected individuals by sex and gender is an important basic step towards personalization of scientific research, drug development, and care. We hypothesize that sex and gender differences, extending from genetic to psychosocial domains, are highly relevant for the understanding of AD pathophysiology, and for the conceptualization of basic/translational research and for clinical therapy trial design.},

	abstract={In this review, we discuss recent work by the ENIGMA Consortium (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu) – a global alliance of over 500 scientists spread across 200 institutions in 35 countries collectively analyzing brain imaging, clinical, and genetic data. Initially formed to detect genetic influences on brain measures, ENIGMA has grown to over 30 working groups studying 12 major brain diseases by pooling and comparing brain data. In some of the largest neuroimaging studies to date – of schizophrenia and major depression – ENIGMA has found replicable disease effects on the brain that are consistent worldwide, as well as factors that modulate disease effects. In partnership with other consortia including ADNI, CHARGE, IMAGEN and others11Abbreviations: ADNI, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (http://www.adni-info.org); CHARGE, the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium (http://www.chargeconsortium.com); IMAGEN, IMAging GENetics Consortium (http://www.imagen-europe.com)., ENIGMA's genomic screens – now numbering over 30,000 MRI scans – have revealed at least 8 genetic loci that affect brain volumes. Downstream of gene findings, ENIGMA has revealed how these individual variants – and genetic variants in general – may affect both the brain and risk for a range of diseases. The ENIGMA consortium is discovering factors that consistently affect brain structure and function that will serve as future predictors linking individual brain scans and genomic data. It is generating vast pools of normative data on brain measures – from tens of thousands of people – that may help detect deviations from normal development or aging in specific groups of subjects. We discuss challenges and opportunities in applying these predictors to individual subjects and new cohorts, as well as lessons we have learned in ENIGMA's efforts so far.},

	abstract={Schizophrenia is a common disorder with a high heritability, but its genetic architecture is still elusive. We implemented whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of 8 families with monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia to assess potential association of de novo mutations (DNMs) or inherited variants with susceptibility to schizophrenia. Eight non-synonymous DNMs (including one splicing site) were identified and shared by twins, which were either located in previously reported schizophrenia risk genes (p.V24689I mutation in TTN, p.S2506T mutation in GCN1L1, IVS3+1G > T in DOCK1) or had a benign to damaging effect according to in silico prediction analysis. By searching the inherited rare damaging or loss-of-function (LOF) variants and common susceptible alleles from three classes of schizophrenia candidate genes, we were able to distill genetic alterations in several schizophrenia risk genes, including GAD1, PLXNA2, RELN and FEZ1. Four inherited copy number variations (CNVs; including a large deletion at 16p13.11) implicated for schizophrenia were identified in four families, respectively. Most of families carried both missense DNMs and inherited risk variants, which might suggest that DNMs, inherited rare damaging variants and common risk alleles together conferred to schizophrenia susceptibility. Our results support that schizophrenia is caused by a combination of multiple genetic factors, with each DNM/variant showing a relatively small effect size.},

	pages={102159},
	note={ID: 282794},
	abstract={Cognitive deficits are important predictors for outcome, independence and quality of life after stroke, but often remain unnoticed and unattended because other impairments are more evident. Computerized cognitive training (CCT) is among the candidate interventions that may alleviate cognitive difficulties, but the evidence supporting its feasibility and effectiveness is scarce, partly due to the lack of tools for outcome prediction and monitoring. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides candidate markers for disease monitoring and outcome prediction. By integrating information not only about lesion extent and localization, but also regarding the integrity of the unaffected parts of the brain, advanced MRI provides relevant information for developing better prediction models in order to tailor cognitive intervention for patients, especially in a chronic phase. Using brain age prediction based on MRI based brain morphometry and machine learning, we tested the hypotheses that stroke patients with a younger-appearing brain relative to their chronological age perform better on cognitive tests and benefit more from cognitive training compared to patients with an older-appearing brain. In this randomized double-blind study, 54 patients who suffered mild stroke (>6 months since hospital admission, NIHSS≤7 at hospital discharge) underwent 3-weeks CCT and MRI before and after the intervention. In addition, patients were randomized to one of two groups receiving either active or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We tested for main effects of brain age gap (estimated age – chronological age) on cognitive performance, and associations between brain age gap and task improvement. Finally, we tested if longitudinal changes in brain age gap during the intervention were sensitive to treatment response. Briefly, our results suggest that longitudinal brain age prediction based on automated brain morphometry is feasible and reliable in stroke patients. However, no significant association between brain age and both performance and response to cognitive training were found.},

	abstract={Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) has a high personal and socio-economic burden and >60% of patients fail to achieve remission with the first antidepressant. The biological mechanisms behind antidepressant response are only partially known but genetic factors play a relevant role. A combined predictor across genetic variants may be useful to investigate this complex trait. Methods Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were used to estimate multi-allelic contribution to: 1) antidepressant efficacy; 2) its overlap with MDD and schizophrenia. We constructed PRS and tested whether these predicted symptom improvement or remission from the GENDEP study (n=736) to the STAR*D study (n=1409) and vice-versa, including the whole sample or only patients treated with escitalopram or citalopram. Using summary statistics from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium for MDD and schizophrenia, we tested whether PRS from these disorders predicted symptom improvement in GENDEP, STAR*D, and five further studies (n=3756). Results No significant prediction of antidepressant efficacy was obtained from PRS in GENDEP/STAR*D but this analysis might have been underpowered. There was no evidence of overlap in the genetics of antidepressant response with either MDD or schizophrenia, either in individual studies or a meta-analysis. Stratifying by antidepressant did not alter the results. Discussion We identified no significant predictive effect using PRS between pharmacogenetic studies. The genetic liability to MDD or schizophrenia did not predict response to antidepressants, suggesting differences between the genetic component of depression and treatment response. Larger or more homogeneous studies will be necessary to obtain a polygenic predictor of antidepressant response.},

	note={ID: 282794},
	abstract={Psychiatric illnesses are complex and polygenic. They are associated with widespread alterations in the brain, which are partly influenced by genetic factors. There have been some attempts to relate polygenic risk scores (PRS) – a measure of the overall genetic risk an individual carries for a disorder – to brain structure using univariate methods. However, PRS are likely associated with distributed and covarying effects across the brain. We therefore used multivariate machine learning in this proof-of-principle study to investigate associations between brain structure and PRS for four psychiatric disorders; attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The sample included 213 individuals comprising patients with depression (69), bipolar disorder (33), and healthy controls (111). The five psychiatric PRSs were calculated based on summary data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were obtained and voxel-based morphometry was implemented in SPM12. Multivariate relevance vector regression was implemented in the Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo). Across the whole sample, a multivariate pattern of grey matter significantly predicted the PRS for autism (r = 0.20, pFDR = 0.03; MSE = 4.20 × 10−5, pFDR = 0.02). For the schizophrenia PRS, the MSE was significant (MSE = 1.30 × 10−5, pFDR = 0.02) although the correlation was not (r = 0.15, pFDR = 0.06). These results lend support to the hypothesis that polygenic liability for autism and schizophrenia is associated with widespread changes in grey matter concentrations. These associations were seen in individuals not affected by these disorders, indicating that this is not driven by the expression of the disease, but by the genetic risk captured by the PRSs.},

	abstract={Summary Parkinson's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder for which both rare and common genetic variants contribute to disease risk, onset, and progression. Mutations in more than 20 genes have been associated with the disease, most of which are highly penetrant and often cause early onset or atypical symptoms. Although our understanding of the genetic basis of Parkinson's disease has advanced considerably, much remains to be done. Further disease-related common genetic variability remains to be identified and the work in identifying rare risk alleles has only just begun. To date, genome-wide association studies have identified 90 independent risk-associated variants. However, most of them have been identified in patients of European ancestry and we know relatively little of the genetics of Parkinson's disease in other populations. We have a limited understanding of the biological functions of the risk alleles that have been identified, although Parkinson's disease risk variants appear to be in close proximity to known Parkinson's disease genes and lysosomal-related genes. In the past decade, multiple efforts have been made to investigate the genetic architecture of Parkinson's disease, and emerging technologies, such as machine learning, single-cell RNA sequencing, and high-throughput screens, will improve our understanding of genetic risk.},

	note={ID: 282794},
	abstract={Intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), including the default mode network (DMN), central executive network (CEN), and salience network (SN) have been shown to be aberrant in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The purpose of the current study was to a) compare ICN functional connectivity between PTSD, dissociative subtype PTSD (PTSD+DS) and healthy individuals; and b) to examine the use of multivariate machine learning algorithms in classifying PTSD, PTSD+DS, and healthy individuals based on ICN functional activation. Our neuroimaging dataset consisted of resting-state fMRI scans from 186 participants [PTSD (n = 81); PTSD + DS (n = 49); and healthy controls (n = 56)]. We performed group-level independent component analyses to evaluate functional connectivity differences within each ICN. Multiclass Gaussian Process Classification algorithms within PRoNTo software were then used to predict the diagnosis of PTSD, PTSD+DS, and healthy individuals based on ICN functional activation. When comparing the functional connectivity of ICNs between PTSD, PTSD+DS and healthy controls, we found differential patterns of connectivity to brain regions involved in emotion regulation, in addition to limbic structures and areas involved in self-referential processing, interoception, bodily self-consciousness, and depersonalization/derealization. Machine learning algorithms were able to predict with high accuracy the classification of PTSD, PTSD+DS, and healthy individuals based on ICN functional activation. Our results suggest that alterations within intrinsic connectivity networks may underlie unique psychopathology and symptom presentation among PTSD subtypes. Furthermore, the current findings substantiate the use of machine learning algorithms for classifying subtypes of PTSD illness based on ICNs.},

This article focuses on the link between biological aging, psychological stressors, and mental illness. Rather than comprehensively reviewing this rapidly expanding field, we highlight challenges in this area of research and propose potential strategies to accelerate progress in this field. This effort requires the interaction of scientists across disciplines - including biology, psychiatry, psychology, and epidemiology; and across levels of analysis that emphasize different outcome measures - functional capacity, physiological, cellular, and molecular. Dialogues across disciplines and levels of analysis naturally lead to new opportunities for discovery but also to stimulating challenges. Some important challenges consist of 1) establishing the best objective and predictive biological age indicators or combinations of indicators, 2) identifying the basis for inter-individual differences in the rate of biological aging, and 3) examining to what extent interventions can delay, halt or temporarily reverse aging trajectories. Discovering how psychological states influence biological aging, and vice versa, has the potential to create novel and exciting opportunities for healthcare and possibly yield insights into the fundamental mechanisms that drive human aging.},

Hi-C datasets provided an unexpected link between locus-specific abnormal expansion of repeat sequences positioned at the boundaries of self-associating topological chromatin domains, and monogenic neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, integrative cell-type-specific Hi-C and transcriptomic analysis uncovered an expanded genomic risk space for sequences conferring liability for schizophrenia and other cognitive disease.

	abstract={Introduction The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has continued development and standardization of methodologies for biomarkers and has provided an increased depth and breadth of data available to qualified researchers. This review summarizes the over 400 publications using ADNI data during 2014 and 2015. Methods We used standard searches to find publications using ADNI data. Results (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes to hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of hippocampus, and disruption to functional networks, are detectable in presymptomatic subjects before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with abnormal β-amyloid deposition (Aβ+), biomarkers become abnormal in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade hypothesis; (3) Cognitive decline is more closely linked to tau than Aβ deposition; (4) Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with Aβ to increase white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different patterns of atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and executive function and may underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6) Structural, functional, and metabolic network connectivities are disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of Aβ pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical Aβ deposition and declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and protective gene loci have been identified using biologically informed approaches; (8) Cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are heterogeneous and include groups typified not only by “classic” AD pathology but also by normal biomarkers, accelerated decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) Selection of subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more pathologies improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of cognitive outcome measures to early changes in cognition has been improved and surrogate outcome measures using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging may further reduce clinical trial cost and duration; (11) Advances in machine learning techniques such as neural networks have improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy especially in challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) Network connectivity measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal classification and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling multimodal classifiers. Discussion Taken together, these studies fundamentally deepen our understanding of AD progression and its underlying genetic basis, which in turn informs and improves clinical trial design.},

	abstract={Data science and digital technologies have the potential to transform diagnostic classification. Digital technologies enable the collection of big data, and advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence enable scalable, rapid, and automated classification of medical conditions. In this review, we summarize and categorize various data-driven methods for diagnostic classification. In particular, we focus on autism as an example of a challenging disorder due to its highly heterogeneous nature. We begin by describing the frontier of data science methods for the neuropsychiatry of autism. We discuss early signs of autism as defined by existing pen-and-paper–based diagnostic instruments and describe data-driven feature selection techniques for determining the behaviors that are most salient for distinguishing children with autism from neurologically typical children. We then describe data-driven detection techniques, particularly computer vision and eye tracking, that provide a means of quantifying behavioral differences between cases and controls. We also describe methods of preserving the privacy of collected videos and prior efforts of incorporating humans in the diagnostic loop. Finally, we summarize existing digital therapeutic interventions that allow for data capture and longitudinal outcome tracking as the diagnosis moves along a positive trajectory. Digital phenotyping of autism is paving the way for quantitative psychiatry more broadly and will set the stage for more scalable, accessible, and precise diagnostic techniques in the field.},

	abstract={Summary Background Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Parkinson's disease have increased the scope of biological knowledge about the disease over the past decade. We aimed to use the largest aggregate of GWAS data to identify novel risk loci and gain further insight into the causes of Parkinson's disease. Methods We did a meta-analysis of 17 datasets from Parkinson's disease GWAS available from European ancestry samples to nominate novel loci for disease risk. These datasets incorporated all available data. We then used these data to estimate heritable risk and develop predictive models of this heritability. We also used large gene expression and methylation resources to examine possible functional consequences as well as tissue, cell type, and biological pathway enrichments for the identified risk factors. Additionally, we examined shared genetic risk between Parkinson's disease and other phenotypes of interest via genetic correlations followed by Mendelian randomisation. Findings Between Oct 1, 2017, and Aug 9, 2018, we analysed 7·8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms in 37 688 cases, 18 618 UK Biobank proxy-cases (ie, individuals who do not have Parkinson's disease but have a first degree relative that does), and 1·4 million controls. We identified 90 independent genome-wide significant risk signals across 78 genomic regions, including 38 novel independent risk signals in 37 loci. These 90 variants explained 16–36% of the heritable risk of Parkinson's disease depending on prevalence. Integrating methylation and expression data within a Mendelian randomisation framework identified putatively associated genes at 70 risk signals underlying GWAS loci for follow-up functional studies. Tissue-specific expression enrichment analyses suggested Parkinson's disease loci were heavily brain-enriched, with specific neuronal cell types being implicated from single cell data. We found significant genetic correlations with brain volumes (false discovery rate-adjusted p=0·0035 for intracranial volume, p=0·024 for putamen volume), smoking status (p=0·024), and educational attainment (p=0·038). Mendelian randomisation between cognitive performance and Parkinson's disease risk showed a robust association (p=8·00 × 10−7). Interpretation These data provide the most comprehensive survey of genetic risk within Parkinson's disease to date, to the best of our knowledge, by revealing many additional Parkinson's disease risk loci, providing a biological context for these risk factors, and showing that a considerable genetic component of this disease remains unidentified. These associations derived from European ancestry datasets will need to be followed-up with more diverse data.

	note={ID: 273545},
	abstract={We refer to omics imaging as an emerging interdisciplinary field concerned with the integration of data collected from biomedical images and omics analyses. Bringing together information coming from different sources, it permits to reveal hidden genotype–phenotype relationships, with the aim of better understanding the onset and progression of many diseases, and identifying new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. More in detail, biomedical images, generated by anatomical or functional techniques, are processed to extract hundreds of numerical features describing visual aspects – as in solid cancer imaging – or functional elements – as in neuroimaging. These imaging features are then complemented and integrated with genotypic and phenotypic information, such as DNA mutations, RNA expression levels, and protein abundances. Apart from the difficulties arising from imaging and omics analyses alone, the process of integrating, combining, processing, and making sense of the omics imaging data is quite challenging, owed to the heterogeneity of the sources, the high dimensionality of the resulting feature space, and the reduced availability of freely accessible, large, and well-curated datasets containing both images and omics data for each sample. In this review, we present the state of the art of omics imaging, with the aim of providing the interested reader a unique source of information, with links for further detailed information. Based on the existing literature, we describe both the omics and imaging data that have been adopted, provide a list of curated databases of integrated resources, discuss the types of adopted features, give hints on the used data analysis methods, and overview current research in this field.},

	abstract={The brain is increasingly viewed in contemporary neuroscience as a predictive machine; its products, such as movements and decisions, are indeed accompanied by predictions of outcomes at distinct levels of awareness. In this conceptual review, we focus on corollary discharge, a basic neurophysiological mechanism that is allegedly involved in sensory prediction and contributes to the distinction between self-generated and externally generated actions. Failures in corollary discharge have been hypothesized as potentially relevant for the progressive development of positive psychotic symptoms such as passivity delusions and auditory verbal hallucinations. We articulate this framework adopting three confocal lenses, namely, the neurodevelopmental, phenomenological, and clinical perspectives. Converging evidence from these research domains indicates a possible developmental cascade leading to increased lifetime risk of psychosis. That is, early childhood alterations of corollary discharge mechanisms, endophenotypically expressed in motor impairment, may concur with a progressive fading of the feeling of self-agency on one’s own experiences. Combined with other age-dependent situational challenges occurring along development, this may progressively hamper the ontogenesis of the embodied self, thereby facilitating the emergence of anomalous subjective experiences such as self-disorders (a longitudinal index of schizophrenia spectrum vulnerability) and broadly conceived clinical high-risk states. Overall, this condition increases the risk of developing passivity symptoms, phenotypically expressed in a severity gradient ranging from intrusive thoughts to passivity delusions and auditory verbal hallucinations. Empirical and clinical implications of this framework, as well as future scenarios, are discussed.},

	abstract={Neurodevelopmental disorders have a strong genetic component, but despite widespread efforts, the specific genetic factors underlying these disorders remain undefined for a large proportion of affected individuals. Given the accessibility of exome sequencing, this problem has thus far been addressed from a protein-centric standpoint; however, protein-coding regions only make up ∼1% to 2% of the human genome. With the advent of whole genome sequencing we are in the midst of a paradigm shift as it is now possible to interrogate the entire sequence of the human genome (coding and noncoding) to fill in the missing heritability of complex disorders. These new technologies bring new challenges, as the number of noncoding variants identified per individual can be overwhelming, making it prudent to focus on noncoding regions of known function, for which the effects of variation can be predicted and directly tested to assess pathogenicity. The 3′UTRome is a region of the noncoding genome that perfectly fulfills these criteria and is of high interest when searching for pathogenic variation related to complex neurodevelopmental disorders. Herein, we review the regulatory roles of the 3′UTRome as binding sites for microRNAs or RNA binding proteins, or during alternative polyadenylation. We detail existing evidence that these regions contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders and outline strategies for identification and validation of novel putatively pathogenic variation in these regions. This evidence suggests that studying the 3′UTRome will lead to the identification of new risk factors, new candidate disease genes, and a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	abstract={Background In the past decades, substantial effort has been made to explore the genetic influence on brain structural/functional abnormalities in schizophrenia, as well as cognitive impairments. In this work, we aimed to extend previous studies to explore the internal mediation pathway among genetic factor, brain features and cognitive scores in a large Chinese dataset. Methods Gray matter (GM) volume, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), and 4522 schizophrenia-susceptible single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from 905 Chinese subjects were jointly analyzed, to investigate the multimodal association. Based on the identified imaging-genetic pattern, correlations with cognition and mediation analysis were then conducted to reveal the potential mediation pathways. Findings One linked imaging-genetic pattern was identified to be group discriminative, which was also associated with working memory performance. Particularly, GM reduction in thalamus, putamen and bilateral temporal gyrus in schizophrenia was associated with fALFF decrease in medial prefrontal cortex, both were also associated with genetic factors enriched in neuron development, synapse organization and axon pathways, highlighting genes including CSMD1, CNTNAP2, DCC, GABBR2 etc. This linked pattern was also replicated in an independent cohort (166 subjects), which although showed certain age and clinical differences with the discovery cohort. A further mediation analysis suggested that GM alterations significantly mediated the association from SNP to fALFF, while fALFF mediated the association from SNP and GM to working memory performance. Interpretation This study has not only verified the impaired imaging-genetic association in schizophrenia, but also initially revealed a potential genetic-brain-cognition mediation pathway, indicating that polygenic risk factors could exert impact on phenotypic measures from brain structure to function, thus could further affect cognition in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = 	 {Background Mental disorders and individual characteristics such as intelligence and personality are complex traits sharing a largely unknown neuronal basis. Their genetic architectures are highly polygenic and overlapping, which is supported by heterogeneous phenotypic expression and substantial clinical overlap. Brain network analysis provides a noninvasive means of dissecting biological heterogeneity, yet its sensitivity, specificity, and validity in assessing individual characteristics relevant for brain function and mental health and their genetic underpinnings in clinical applications remain a challenge. Methods In a machine learning approach, we predicted individual scores for educational attainment, fluid intelligence and dimensional measures of depression, anxiety, and neuroticism using functional magnetic resonance imaging–based static and dynamic temporal synchronization between large-scale brain network nodes in 10,343 healthy individuals from the UK Biobank. In addition to using age and sex to serve as our reference point, we also predicted individual polygenic scores for related phenotypes and 13 different neuroticism traits and schizophrenia. Results Beyond high accuracy for age and sex, supporting the biological sensitivity of the connectome-based features, permutation tests revealed above chance-level prediction accuracy for trait-level educational attainment and fluid intelligence. Educational attainment and fluid intelligence were mainly negatively associated with static brain connectivity in frontal and default mode networks, whereas age showed positive correlations with a more widespread pattern. In contrast, prediction accuracy was at chance level for depression, anxiety, neuroticism, and polygenic scores across traits. Conclusions These novel findings provide a benchmark for future studies linking the genetic architecture of individual and mental health traits with functional magnetic resonance imaging–based brain connectomics.},
